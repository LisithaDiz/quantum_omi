Omi is a Sri Lankan card game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The game is typically played by four players, and the objective is to win the most number of hands. The game has been around for many years and has become an integral part of Sri Lankan culture. It is often played during special occasions such as funerals, weddings, festivals, and other celebrations. 

In recent years, the game has gained popularity among younger generations, and there are now several mobile apps available that allow players to play Omi online. These apps have helped to keep the game alive and relevant in today's digital age. 

As the game has become more popular within schools and colleges, embedding a quantum aspect to the game was seen as a method to raise awareness about quantum technologies among the younger generation.
